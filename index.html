    Currently i have a school project in which i'm asked to create an ftp server and client. So what is ftp? Acording to Wikipedia the file transfer protocol (FTP) is a standard system of digital rules for data exchange, a format convention. It is used to transfer computer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network.
    After searching a bit online and looking in wireshark here is what we know:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ftp has two modes passive and active.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ftp uses two connections the data conection and the command connection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The command connection uses the telnet protocol specification.
    </li>
    <li>
        A new data conection is made each time we start an exchange.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is an ascii and a binary mode
    </li>  
</ul>
